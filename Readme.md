## OVERVIEW 

Since this Covid era has shifted the hackathons to an online mode, organisers are getting their best for enhancing the engagement of the participants as well as providing them with the same amazing experience that they had offline.

Thus, to help our organisers build a better online experience, we have come up with our website HCONNECT that will help our hackers enhance as well as grow individually and as a team. 

Morever, there is a common issue of team formation faced by the hackers that we have tried to solve through our website. With the help of our website, we will be able to enhance networking in the online hackathon by providing them with a good user interface.

Thank you.
